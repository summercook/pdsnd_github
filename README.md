### Project Title
Bikeshare Project

### Description
Describe what your project is about and what it does
This data provides data about bikeshare statistics for Chicago, New York City and Washington.
It is an interactive program that allows the user to choose which city they would like
see data for. The user can filter according to day, month, or not at all. The user may
also see raw data and can choose the number of rows/trips they would like to see at once.
The user has the option at the end of the questionnaire to restart and continue to see other
cities or filter as they wish.

### Files used

### Credits
